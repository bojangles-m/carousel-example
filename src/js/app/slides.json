After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was ‘surrounded by idiots’, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people.\n\nSurrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide.
